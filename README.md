Predictive Analysis with ML model building to identify attributes needed for a song to be popular

# 1. Business Problem

In today's highly competitive music industry, both artists and music streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube face the challenge of providing a personalized and engaging music experience to users. To address this challenge, there is a pressing need to capture and analyze a diverse set of data, including trend-based metrics (such as likes, comments, views, and streaming statistics) and song-specific attributes (e.g., valence, speechiness, danceability) to enhance user satisfaction, empower creators, and optimize content management.

## Objective

The objective is to construct a predictive model for assessing the popularity of songs not just on the basis of customer responses but also based on the inherent characteristics of a song like Danceability, Acousticness, Valence, etc. We have picked up the dataset comprising of data from Spotify and YouTube.

## Business Objectives

1. Enhanced User Experience: By understanding user preferences and behavior, songs and playlists that resonate with individual tastes, leading to increased user retention and satisfaction, can be recommended.
2. Empowering Creators: Equipping artists and composers with in-depth insights into song attributes, such as valence, speechiness, and danceability, enables them to better understand their audience's preferences. This knowledge can inform their creative process, helping them produce music that resonates with their target audience.

# 2. Data Requirements

The data needed to answer the above problem will be a combined dataset of about top 20,000 tracks, artists, and albums from Spotify and YouTube containing 27 features driven through customer experience - likes, comments, views as well as abstract attributes of a track which numerically explains a song's level of energy, tonality, perceived positivity, volume, rhythm, spoken elements, etc.

# 3. Data Collection

The data has been extracted from Spotify and YouTube and combined into a single dataset.

# 4. Analytics Approach

The analytics approach is Predictive.
